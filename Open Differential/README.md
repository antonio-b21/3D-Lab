&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have chosen to design the Open Differential for my final project in 3D Modeling and Printing because I like mechanisms and everything around them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A differential is a gear train with three shafts that has the property that the rotational speed of one shaft is the average of the speeds of the others, or a fixed multiple of that average. The drive shaft, which carries the torque produced by the transmission, has a bevel gear shaped end. Adding a bevel gear ring to that, a bevel gear set is obtained. Thus, the power flow is turned by 90 degrees, the torque is doubled, whereas the angular velocity is halved. The back of the bevel gear ring is extended to create a carrier for another two bevel gears. Those two will either stay still, either rotate in opposite direction having the same absolute angular velocity. Connected to them will be two bevel gears that turn the output shafts, one pair for each side.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An open differential always supplies close to equal torque to each side, as you can notice by playing the "Going Straight" motion study. To illustrate how this can limit torque applied to the driving wheels, imagine a simple rear-wheel drive vehicle, with one rear roadwheel on asphalt with good grip, and the other on a patch of slippery ice. It takes very little torque to spin the side on slippery ice, and because a differential splits torque equally to each side, the torque that is applied to the side that is on asphalt is limited to this amount. This phenomenon can be observed in the "Right Wheel Stuck" motion study, where the torque delivered to the wheel with good grip is not enough to turn the wheel, but the torque delivered to the other wheel is more than sufficient. Also, consider the case when the vehicle is taking a right turn. The wheel that is farther from the center of the turns circle has to travel more distance, and, thereby, to spin faster as you can see in the "Turning Left" motion study.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1827, the French mechanical engineer **On√©siphore Pecqueur** patented the modern-day differential gear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project was made in Autodesk Fusion 360.
