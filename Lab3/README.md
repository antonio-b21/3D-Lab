# Homework #3

## Tasks:
1. Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture history
is not turned on).

2. Import an SVG ([link here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hP3PDJ7wgEmkW3Iuby4fesoqEDkGd0BF)) and design a chess pieces set.

3. Use the SVG sketch to revolve the pieces:
a. you need to take care when designing the knight; only the base
should be revolved; find another solution for the horse part e.g:
extrusion, fillet, etc.
b. when designing the bishop, revolve the part that doesn’t have the
slit, and add the slit after.

4. When using revolve, you need two things: the profile and the axis:
a. For the profile, you will use half of the chess piece (Fig.1 dark blue
part)
b. For the axis, you will use a line (Fig. 1 the red line) that cuts the
piece in half.
c. You need to add this line by yourself, editing the SVG sketch using
constraints (don’t add it using a new sketch, it needs to be in the
same sketch for the revolve to work).

5. Use a circular pattern to add details on the top, neck and base of the
pieces.
6. The SVG is a little bit stylized. The chess pieces contain smaller parts that
are not connected. For the full grade, you need to find a way to make each
chess piece only one body! (Fig. 2)

7. Slice all the pieces in PrusaSlicer.
